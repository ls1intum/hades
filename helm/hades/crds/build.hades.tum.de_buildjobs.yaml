          BuildJob is the Schema for the buildjobs API in Hades operator mode.
          A BuildJob represents a multi-step CI/CD pipeline execution, where each step runs in a container.
          Steps execute sequentially in order of their ID, with shared data passed between steps via volumes.

                  so retrying is usually not beneficial.
