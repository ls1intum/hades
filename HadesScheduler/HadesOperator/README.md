# hadesoperator
The **Hades Operator** brings Kubernetes-native automation to the [HadesCI](https://github.com/ls1intum/hades) system â€” a scalable job execution tool built for programming exercises and CI pipelines.

This Operator helps run, schedule, and manage Hades build jobs inside a Kubernetes cluster, using native APIs and cloud-native patterns. It improves scalability, reliability, and simplifies deployment.


## Description
The Hades Operator is designed to:

- Schedule and execute CI build jobs as Kubernetes custom resources.
- Automatically handle retries and failure recovery using native Kubernetes features.
- Improve scalability during high traffic (e.g. student exams with many submissions).
- Collect build logs using for easier debugging and monitoring.
- Simplify deployment and upgrades with Helm.
- Apply fine-grained access control using Kubernetes ServiceAccounts and RBAC.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.24.0+
- docker version 17.05+.
- kubectl version v1.14.0+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.16.0+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Deploy the Operator to the cluster:**

> **NOTE**: Make sure you are under the root directory.

```sh
  cat ./helm/hades/values.yaml
```
- Modify the value `hadesScheduler.configMode` to be `operator`
- (Optional) If you want to have the operator to have the Cluster wide access, 
  modify `hadesOperator.clusterWide` top be `true`
```sh
  helm upgrade --install hades ./helm/hades -n hades --create-namespace
```
Alternative, run
```sh
  helm upgrade --install hades ./helm/hades -n hades --create-namespace \
      --set hadesScheduler.configMode=operator \
```
> **NOTE**: These commands will install the project within the hades namespace.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
  kubectl apply -k ./HadesScheduler/HadesOperator/config/samples/build_v1_buildjob.yaml
```
