# Contributing to Hades

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Hades as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Development Workflow

1. Set up your development environment by following the instructions in the README.md
2. Make your changes and test them thoroughly
3. Ensure your code follows the Go style guidelines
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Update documentation as needed

## Style Guidelines

- Follow the standard Go style guidelines
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Document public functions and types
- Write clear commit messages explaining what and why rather than how
